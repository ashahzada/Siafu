<p>A simulation of the small city of Leimen, Germany. Peolpe lead a simple, yet satisfying life. They wake up in the morning, go to their offices (sometimes by car), then either go home, or go party, returning home sometimes early. Early in the morning. Next day they go work again.</p>

<p>This simulation has a lot of places, so it takes quite some memory. Either reduce the cache size in the Siafu configuration, or increase the memory avaialble to your JVM by running it with -Xmx400M, for instance.</p>
