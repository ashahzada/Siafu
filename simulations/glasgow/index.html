Simulation of a Campus in Glasgow. While not being as big as a city, this is a good example of outdoors simulation. The behavior is pretty vanilla, with agents going in an out of buildings (gaussian distributed traffic) and two users, Andy and Ralf, standing by for commands. This is one example of demo simulation, where you can bind your applications to the context of Ralf or Andy, and show your application change according to their actions.
