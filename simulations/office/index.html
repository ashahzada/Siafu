This simulation illustrates an indoor office scenario. Agents get to work in the morning, stay at their desk and go to the toilet (queueing when necessary). Additionally, the conference room Place organizes a meeting every morning, attracting 8 staff members to it. The simulation further simulate the noise level in the office and the range of the WiFi hotspots.
