<p>A very simple test simulation, used to try out the simulator and further develop it. It comprises a labirynth-like map where agents wander around zombie style. Three agents are special, however: Teresa and Pietro stay put for the user to control, and the Postman runs errands from point A to B. Tirelessly.</p>
